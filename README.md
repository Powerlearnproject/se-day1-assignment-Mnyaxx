Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software in a structured way. As for its importance it provides: 
Making software high-quality and easy to maintain.
Reducing time and cost in development.
Ensuring security and reliability.
Allowing teams to work together effectively.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of Programming Languages (1950s-1960s) – Early languages like FORTRAN and COBOL made programming easier and more structured.
Introduction of Software Development Models (1970s-1980s) – The Waterfall model and structured programming helped improve the development process.
The Shift to Agile and DevOps (2000s-Present) – Agile and DevOps improved teamwork, flexibility, and efficiency in software development.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis – Understanding what the software needs to do.
Planning – Defining goals, budget, and schedule.
Design – Creating plans and structures for the software.
Implementation (Coding) – Writing the actual code.
Testing – Checking for errors and making sure everything works.
Deployment – Releasing the software to users.
Maintenance – Fixing bugs and making updates.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall process is step-by-step while Agile repeats in cycles.
Waterfall is more structured while Agile is more flexible.
Waterfall is more predictable while Agile is more adaptable.
Waterfall customer involvement takes place at the beginning and end only while Agile is continuous feedback.
Waterfall is best used in large and stable projects with clear and fixed requirements like banking software while Agile is used for fast-changing projects such as mobile apps.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes and tests code.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Finds and fixes software problems.
Project Manager – Organizes tasks, timelines, and communication.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Tools that help developers write and test code (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS): Track changes and allow multiple people to work on the same project (e.g., Git, GitHub).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Fixing Bugs → Use debugging tools and logs.
Meeting Deadlines → Use project planning tools and work in small steps.
Security Risks → Follow safe coding practices and test for vulnerabilities.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Checks small parts of the code.
Integration Testing – Ensures different sections work together.
System Testing – Tests the whole software.
Acceptance Testing – Confirms the software meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of creating clear and detailed instructions for AI models. It helps:
Get better and more relevant responses.
Reduce incorrect or biased outputs.
Improve how AI assists in problem-solving.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about history."

Improved Prompt: "Summarize key historical events from the 20th century in Africa, focusing on wars and tribalism."

Why the Improved Prompt is Better:
It specifies the timeframe (20th century).
It narrows the focus (wars and tribalism).
It ensures clarity and relevance.
